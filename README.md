# Non-Invasive-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Detection-using-Facial-Anthropometrics
The strategy for thisproject on non-invasive ASD detection seamlessly 
blends theoretical synthesis with practical 
implementation. Anchored in anthropometric 
measurements, our exploration involves meticulous 
experimentation utilizing Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. This dual 
approach seeks not only to validate the efficacy of 
these models in real-world scenarios but also to establish a crucial link between theoretical insights 
and hands-on application. 
For practical implementation, our focus on 
educational purposes led us to employ transfer 
learning models, including VGG16 & VGG19. We
initiated the process by curating a diverse dataset, 
subjecting it to rigorous preprocessing to ensure 
quality and relevance. The trained models underwent 
a systematic training process, involving feeding the 
data through the pre-trained layers of the selected 
models and fine-tuning them specifically for ASD 
detection. To evaluate each model's performance 
comprehensively, we conducted a rigorous 
comparison based on key metrics such as accuracies, 
F1 scores, and testing accuracy. The outcomes were 
further dissected using a confusion matrix, providing 
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of 
each model. This systematic approach not only 
facilitated practical learning experiences for 
educational purposes but also enabled a critical
evaluation of the suitability of each model in the 
context of ASD detection. The results significantly 
contribute to advancing our understanding of effective ASD detection methodologies and their 
practical implications.
